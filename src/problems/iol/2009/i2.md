The following are words of the Maninka and Bamana languages
written in the N’Ko and the Roman script and their English translations:

**(a)**

**(b)**
:div[![b](/pimg/iol2009i2-2.png)]{.width-1000 .center}

Fill in the gaps.

**Note.** The N’Ko script was invented in 1949 by the Guinean enlightener Soulemayne Kante.
In the Roman script j = j in judge, y = y in yay!, E ≈ a in hat, O ≈ a in hall. The marks ´␣
and `␣ indicate high and low tone (level of voice when pronouncing the syllable), respectively; if
neither is present, the syllable has middle tone.
<br>The Bamana and Maninka languages belong to the Manding group of the Mande language
family. They are spoken in Mali, Guinea and other countries in West Africa. These languages are
very close to one another; the distinction between them is of no consequence to the problem.
