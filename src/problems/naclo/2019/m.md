Modern logicians represent the logical relationships between statements with a straightforward notation. For
example, if we represent the statement "Canada is beautiful" with p, then we can represent the statement
"Canada isn't beautiful" with -p (read as "not p"). If we have two statements represented by p and q, then
we can represent "if p, then q" as p-q, and similarly we can represent "p and q" and "p or q" as p^q and
p'q, respectively. Pretty easy, right?

But things weren't always this clear! In 1879, German logician Gottlob Frege published a seminal work on logic called *Begriffsschrift*, which literally translates to "concept script". The notation he used, also called *Begriffsschrift*, confused many readers with its two-dimensional format and use of few symbols. That being said,
the *Begriffsschrift* notation is a carefully thought-out system that adheres to formal rules. Here are some examples of *Begriffsschrift* formulas, with their translations into modern logical notation.

Begriffsschrift ain't just pretty to look at! It's also a meaningful logical language. As an example, consider the
following facts which you may not have known about astrophysics:

All quaxors are galactions. Most of those pulsoids with a sateotrope are galactions, too. A pulsoid with a
sateotrope is only not a galaction when it is dingly. (Of course, all this only holds true if the polyverse is
Groop-normal.)

**M2.** Match these sentences to letters A to F to correctly complete the *Begriffsschrift* formula below (note
that there are two possible correct answers) in your answer sheets:

:::div{.lmargin2}
i. x is a galaction
ii. the polyverse is Groop-normal
ili. x is dingly
iv. x has a sateotrope
v. x is a quaxor
vi. x is a pulsoid
