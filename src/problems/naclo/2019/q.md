The *Tale of Kieu* is an epic poem written in Vietnamese by author *Nguyên Du* in 1820, which details the life of
the talented young woman *Thúy Kiều*. The poem is composed of 1,627 couplets, or groups of two lines. Here
are some couplets from *The Tale of Kieu* in no particular order:


:::ntable{fmt=1 .no1Count .no2Count .width-fit}
1\. & Trăm năm trong cõi người ta,
& Chư᷈ tài chư᷈ mê̩nh khéo là ghét nhau.
2\. & Dầu lòng hai ả tố nga,
& Thúy Kiều là chi̩, em là Thúy Vân.
3\. & Nửa năm hơi tiếng vùa quen,
& Sân ngô cành biếc dã chen lá vàng.
4\. & Vân rằng: Chi̩ cu᷈ng nư̩c cười,
& Khéo dư nước mắt khóc người dời xưa.
5\. & Người dâu gă̩p gơ᷈ làm chi,
& Trăm năm biết có duyên gì hay không?
:::

Each couplet of the *Tale* is written in the poetic meter known as *lục bát*[^1], which has several rules. Even if we
don't speak Vietnamese, we can still use these rules to identify whether a couplet has been corrupted. For
example, here is a corrupted version of couplet #1:

:::ntable{.no1Count .no2Count .padding-none .border-hidden .width-fit}
1a. & Tram nam trong dài nguòi ta,
& Chû tai chû mênh khéo là ghét nhau.
:::

This couplet does not follow the rules of *lục bát* and consequently must have been corrupted. However, this
is not always the case. Consider this other corruption to couplet #1:

:::ntable{.no1Count .no2Count .padding-none .border-hidden .width-fit}
1b. & Tram nam trong cá nguòi ta,
& Ch tài chû mênh khéo là ghét nhau.
:::

This corrupted version of couplet #1 still follows the rules of *lục bát*; we would need to know Vietnamese in
order to determine that there was a mistake.

In Vietnamese, the diacritics (accent marks) *á*, *à*, *ả*, *ạ*, *ã* indicate five of the six Vietnamese tones (known as
*sắc*, *huyền*, *hỏi*, *nǎ̩ng*, and *ngã* respectively); the absence of a diacritic indicates the sixth tone, *ngang*. Importantly, the diacritics *â*, *ă*, *ê*, *ơ*, *ư* do not represent tones; instead, they represent slight changes to the pronunciation of the vowels. Traditionally, Vietnamese tones are divided into two groups: *sharp* tones, of which
there are four, and *flat* tones, of which there are two.

**Q1.** Which tones belong to which groups? Write your answer on the answer sheets.

While searching in your local library for linguistics papers, you find six more couplets from The Tale of Kieu.
However, some have been damaged. Only two of them have remained uncorrupted -the other four have
had **exactly two words changed or removed** so that they no longer follow the rules of *lục bát*. Fortunately, even if you don't know Vietnamese, you can use the rules of *lục bát* to determine which couplets are original.

**Q2.** Determine which two couplets are authentic and which four have been corrupted. For each couplet,
circle "corrupted" or "authentic". For each corrupted couplet, write the two words which have been
corrupted, or write REMOVED if a word has been removed.

Here is one more couplet from *The Tale of Kieu*. The couplet has been transmitted in damaged form: for
some of the words, two choices are possible (marked in parentheses).

**Q3.** For each combination in parentheses, determine which of the two words is correct. If both of the two
words could occur and still follow the rules, circle the word BOTH. Write your answers on the answer
sheets.

**Q4.** Explain your observations about the structure of *lục bát* in your answer sheets.
