The Hanunó'o script is an indigenous script used to write the Hanunólo language, spoken on Mindoro Island,
northeast of Palawan Province of The Philippines. Traditionally, Hanunó'o was written by carving characters
into strips of bamboo; consequently, it is written vertically (up and down), as opposed to horizontally like the
English alphabet.

Below on the left is a list of Filipino place names written in Hanunó o in random order. On the right is the
same list in Latin script, in a different order. Note that there are two extra cities in the Latin list!
