In 1970, a Ghanaian historian named Kumi Attobrah designed
Pan-African auxiliary language which he
named Afrihili. As was the case with Esperanto (the most widely spoken constructed international auxiliary
language devised in 1887 by L. L. Zamenhof), Attobrah decided to solve the problem of having to create a
large number of unique words by developing an elaborate system of inflections and derivations for making
new words.

Below are some words in Afrihili with their English translations:
