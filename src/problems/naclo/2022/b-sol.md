**B1**
It appears Turkish uses a standard Latin script.
Notice lines 3 and 6 have a common word, so :sol[*fil*=elephant]. Then, we can take advantage of sentence 3 to determine the syntax for Turkish simple sentences: SV.
It then follows that 7 translates to "The elephant jumped."

Now we can form a small Turkish vocabulary:

| Turkish | English |
| - | - |
| Balık | Fish |
| Yüzdü. | swam/verb equivalent |
| Zürafa | Giraffe|
| Koştu. | ran |
| atladı | jumped |

Since yüzdü is swim and 5 and 6 have two common words (swam and like), we can assume :sol[*gibi*=like]. This also gives us an insight for prepositional phrases in Turkish. Finally, we have SOPV as the Turkish syntax.

We can use sentence 4 to determine :sol[*için*=for] and :sol[*Kaplumbağa*=turtle]. **b** quickly follows as :sol[Kaplumbağa balık için koştu.]

**B2**

Virtually every sentence contains the verb *saw*, so :sol[*gördü*=saw]. From A, we notice giraffe has a suffix, *yı*, to represent the object. So, we have SOV as this syntax, where the direct object is modified with this suffix. We can now translate a). With sentence 4, we can remove the suffix, giving us :sol[*martı*=seagull], so our answer becomes "The seagull saw the turtle."

From sentence 6 in B1, we can deduce :sol["ayı"=bear]. We can now do part b with sentence 4 as reference. Adding the suffix to *ayı*, we finally have "Kim ayıyı gördü?".

We recognize "whom" is our object and "bee" is our subject on line 6, giving us kimi for whom (object). Finally, our response becomes Ayı kimi gördü?
