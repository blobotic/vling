Languages are constantly changing. For example, when you talk to your friends, you probably use some
words that did not exist ten years ago. Even the basic grammar of a language can change.

Over time, these changes accumulate until new languages are born. In this way, the English that is spoken
today—known as Present Day English—is descended from a language called Old English, which was spoken
approximately a thousand years ago. Since that time, the language has transformed so much that, if you
wanted to understand Old English, you would need to study it as a foreign language. This problem focuses on
some of the differences between Old English and Present Day English.

Study the table below, which contains some sentences in Old English along with their translations in Present
Day English.[^1]
Then answer the questions on the next three pages.

[^1]: The pronunciation of the letters is not important for this problem, but see the end of the problem for pronunciation notes.

**Some more information about Old English:** If someone referred to Old English, would you think of the
language of Shakespeare, who was active at the end of the sixteenth century and the beginning of the
seventeenth, or possibly of Geoffrey Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, written circa 1385? In the standard
historical division of English, Shakespeare’s language is actually Early Modern English, while Chaucer was
writing late Middle English. English was brought to England from Germany and northern Denmark in the
early fifth century, and before the conversion of the English to Christianity, was occasionally written in
inscriptions using the Germanic runic alphabet. A small number of English writings in the Latin alphabet
appear circa 700, but it is only in the ninth century that we find a substantial body of texts. The Old English
(also known as Anglo-Saxon) period extended to circa 1100, when enough changes to the language had
happened that it would be unintelligible to the people who brought the language to England. If Old English
would have been incomprehensible to the speakers of the Middle English period, this is even more true for
Present Day English speakers.

**Additional notes:**
- For the most part, Latin letters were used to represent similar sounds in Old English. The letter <æ>
(which is capitalized as <Æ>) represented a vowel similar to that in Present Day English hat. The symbol
<þ>, called thorn, comes from the runic alphabet and was used to represent sounds not found in Latin,
the two sounds of <th> in Present Day English this and thigh.
- Word order in Old English was flexible. In your answers for this problem, you should only use the word
orders illustrated in the example sentences
