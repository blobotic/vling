While touring the **sìì jaŋgide᷆** ("school"), you attempt to learn a few words of Nizaa, with the help of a few
trusty flashcards. Unfortunately, someone failed to print the flashcards double-sided! Your job is to match
the Nizaa (left) and English (right) back together.

**Notes:** Nizaa is spoken by about 10,000 people in Cameroon. Anthocleista vogelii is a species of tree that thrives in the
rainforest. A calabash is a gourd (a type of hard-shelled fruit, similar to a pumpkin) that is often hollowed out and
dried for use as a container. Pronunciation is not relevant for solving this problem, but ɓ, ŋ, and ɗ are consonants; ʉ, ɛ,
and ɔ are vowels; and marks above vowels indicate tone—the pitch used when pronouncing a vowel.

**F1.** On your Answer Sheets, indicate which English translations go with which Nizaa words and phrases.
