The Iguvine Tablets are a series of inscriptions on bronze found in the Italian town of Gubbio, which is on the
site of the ancient Roman town of Iguvium. These tablets are written in the ancient Umbrian language, which
is closely related to Latin, the language of the ancient Romans. The original translators of the tablets used
the similarity of many words to their Latin “relatives” to help them determine the meaning of many passages
written in Umbrian.

**I1.** Below are some Umbrian words from the Iguvine tablets, their Latin equivalents, and their English
translations. Fill in the blanks from the table.
