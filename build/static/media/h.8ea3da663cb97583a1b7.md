Pronouns are words like *us* or *she* that refer to a person or group relevant to the conversation. This problem
is about the system of pronouns in the language Lardil, which is spoken on Mornington Island, off the north
coast of Australia. Lardil’s pronoun system may seem complex at first, but it is organized around a systematic
and logical set of principles.

Below are thirteen groups of people, followed by pronouns that could refer to them in Lardil. Note that the
Lardil words are not translations of the English—they are pronouns that could refer to the group described in
English, similar to how the English pronoun us is not defined as “Alex and me” but might refer to “Alex and
me” in a particular context. The English and Lardil are in the same order as each other, not scrambled.

would you use to refer to:
a. you, I, and our grandfather
b. you, I, and our aunt
