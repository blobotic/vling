Classical Nahuatl was the language of the Aztec Empire. Although Classical Nahuatl is no longer actively
spoken, it is related to modern Nahuatl, which has approximately 1.5 million speakers, mainly in Mexico.

Over the centuries, scholars have proposed several different writing systems for representing Classical
Nahuatl. Some early approaches from the 16th century were based on the system used for Spanish at the
time. However, this approach faced challenges in how to represent sounds and distinctions that were not
present in Spanish.

One solution is to use the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). The IPA is designed to represent all sounds
of human speech unambiguously, and so it provides a reliable transcription system that can be read by
linguists across the world. However, the IPA is often unwieldy and does not reflect the needs of particular
language communities. Therefore, the IPA is rarely used by non-linguists.

Some more recent proposals are therefore designed specifically with Nahuatl in mind, in order to ensure
both ease of use (which the IPA lacks) and faithfulness to the language (which the 16th
-century systems
lacked). To illustrate some of the writing systems that have been proposed over the years, the name of the
Nahuatl language can be written as *nahuatlatolli* in a 16th
-century writing system, /nawatɬaʔtoːlli/ in the IPA,
or *nahuatlàtōlli* in a 20th
-century writing system.

Below is the first stanza of a Nahuatl poem, “The Song of Temilotzin.” On the left is the poem as it appears in
a manuscript of the 16th century (modified slightly for clarity). On the right, the text has been rewritten in a
system proposed more recently, in the 20th century.

**G1.** Convert the following phrases from the 16th
-century writing system into the IPA:

b. *antocnihuan in* ‘my friends’ & :ans{.med}

**G2.** Convert the following words from the IPA into the 20th
-century writing system:

**G3.** In set theory (a branch of mathematics), it is said that there is a *bijection* between two sets if it is
possible to convert from one set to the other and back without losing any information. This concept can be
extended to describe writing systems. For example, there is a bijection between the set of numbers written
in numerals (e.g., 43 or 11) and the set of numbers written in letters (e.g., *forty-three* or *eleven*). If you ignore
capitalization, there is a bijection between two of the writing systems discussed here. Which two writing
systems are they?
