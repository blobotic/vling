Roon is an Austronesian language with approximately 1,000 speakers in Indonesia. Roon’s terms for
numbers have changed over the years. This problem investigates numbers in Roon at three points in time:
the years 1855, 1955, and 2012. Some number terms have remained unchanged in this time:

:::ntable{fmt=1 }
|Number & 1855 & 1955 & 2012
2 & nuru & nuru & nuru
:::

Others have changed once:

:::ntable{fmt=1 }
|Number & 1855 & 1955 & 2012
10 & onemerim & safur & safur
:::

However, the majority of number terms have changed twice:

:::ntable{fmt=1 }
|Number & 1855 & 1955 & 2012
7 & onemenuru & rimenuru & fik
32 & arzus safur nuru & aresoyier safur nuru & ares kior beberin nuru
:::


**P1.** Below are some more numbers or expressions in Roon, representing the same value in different years. +
and × represent addition and multiplication respectively. Fill in the missing cells. Your answers should include
only one number or number term, not a mathematical expression—that is, you should not use + or ×.
