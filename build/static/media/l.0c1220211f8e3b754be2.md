Teal is currently at the world’s most boring summer camp, Camp Pleasanthill. She wants to tell her parents
about how unpleasant it is, but she is worried that her counselor will intercept her letter. Teal’s parents both
work in machine translation (the field concerned with creating computers that can translate between
languages), which gives Teal an idea for a code that she thinks her parents will be able to decipher without
her counselor knowing what is in the letter. She sends the following piece of paper to her parents, adding
the italicized phrases to trick her counselor:

*A poem of all the things I love to do at Camp Pleasanthill:*

2443: canoeing, the campfire, tennis

312: cabins, food, basketball
::::


**L1.** Teal’s parents translated the first line in the “poem” (*2443: canoeing, the campfire, tennis*) as “the food is
disgusting”. What is the translation of the second line (*312: cabins, food, basketball*)? Write your answer on
your Answer Sheet.

**L2.** Teal sends her parents some more coded messages. The table below shows these coded messages with
their translations, but some parts of the messages are missing. On your Answer Sheet, fill in the blanks.

What does Teal’s code have to do with translation? To help you see the connection, the table below gives
some sentences in Wari' (a language spoken in Brazil and Bolivia) along with their English translations. For
each sentence pair, there is also a mystery sequence that resembles a component of Teal’s code. It is up to
you to figure out what these mystery sequences mean.

**L3.** Some cells in the table are missing. On your Answer Sheet, fill in the missing entries. Notes: The symbol '
stands for a glottal stop—the sound in the middle of the expression *uh-oh*. Hatem and Topa' are women’s
names. 'Orowao' is a man’s name. *sg* stands for *singular*.
