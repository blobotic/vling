The following are four excerpts from Old Norse poems composed
around 900 C.E. All of them are written using the meter named *dróttkvætt* (lit. ‘court meter’):

:::ntable{fmt=1 .no1Count .no2Count}
**I** & **III**
1 **ók at ísarnleiki** & 1 **þekkiligr með þegn**um
2 **Jarðar sunr, en dunði . . .** & 2 **þrymseilar hval deila.**
& 3 **rausnarsamr til rimmu**
& 4 **ríðviggs lagar skíðum.**
**II** & **IV**
3 **en af breiðu bjóði** & 1 **háði gramr, þars gnúð**u,
4 **bragðvíss at þat lagði** & 2 **geira hregg við seggi**, 
5 **ósvífrandi ása** & 3 **(rauð fnýsti ben blóð**i)
6 **upp þjórhluti fjóra.** & 4 **bryngo˛ gl í dyn Sko˛ glar,**
& 5 **þás á rausn fyr ræsi**
& 6 **(réð egglituðr) seggir . . .**
:::

One of the main principles of *dróttkvætt* is alliteration. The first line of each distich (pair of
lines) contains two words beginning with the same sound, and the first word of the second line
begins with this sound, too: e. g., **rausnarsamr**, **rimmu** and **ríðviggs** (III:3–4). All vowels are
considered to alliterate with one another and with **j**: e. g., **ók**, **ísarnleiki** and **Jarðar** (I:1–2).
But this is not the only rule.

The texts given above have been handed down in more than one manuscript. Sometimes
different words are found in corresponding parts of the text, and the scholars have to decide which
of the variants is original. Different considerations may motivate the conclusion. Sometimes the
rules of versification help to recognize some of the variants as false. For example, in line I:2 we
find not only **dunði**, but also **dulði** and **djarfi**. dulði can be rejected because of the structure
of the verse, but both **dunði** and **djarfi** fit into the line, and one needs other reasons to choose
between these words. In line III:1 **Gripnis** and **Grímnis** occur in the manuscripts, but **Grímnis**
doesn’t fulfill the requirements of the verse.

**(a)** Describe the rules which are observed in a distich of dróttkvætt.

**(b)** Given is a stanza in which 13 words are omitted:

**NB:** Old Norse is a North Germanic language which was in use approximately between 700 and
1100 C.E.
<br>**æ** ≈ English *a* in *cat*, œ** = French *eu* or German *ö* (these letters stand for long vowels). **ø** is
read as a short *œ*; **y** = French *u* or German *ü*, **o̩** is an open *o*. **au** and **ei** are pronounced as a
single syllable. **ð** and **þ** = English *th* in *this* and *thin* respectively. **x = k+s**. The mark **´** denotes
vowel length. All samples of poetry in the problem are given in a normalized orthography and
conform to the rules of the genre. :i[—Alexander Piperski]{.right}
