The text said this text made it easier for students to do math, and by looking at the first equation, we can reasonably assume smaller numbers use the number of strokes to determine its magnitude. Particularly, the first line translates to "4-3=1".
Many scripts use special symbols for "5", so we can assume the markings on top represent groups of 5.
Line 3 confirms our hypothesis that 5 is denoted in a special fashion, above the number, giving us 4+8=12.
The first symbol on line 6 represents 7\*8=56. We also know they use positional notation as they are using multiple "blocks" to denote numbers. Here, we have 2(16)_b=56, or b=20.

Now we can decipher the rest of their number system. 2\*4=8, 15-1=14, and 5\*6=30, so our answers for a,b, and c are 4, 15, and 6, respectively.

From D1, we have the following table:

| Arabic | Iñupiaq |
| - | - |
| 1 | atausiq |
| 8 | tallimat piŋasut |
| 12 | qulit malġuk |
| 14 | akimiaġutaiḷaq |
| 16 | akimiaq atausiq |
| 30 | iñuiññaq qulit |

We notice Iñupiaq numerals are already grouped in groups of five, so we assume that the script also shows this distinction, which is confirmed with 1, atausiq, and 16 akimiaq atausiq, (15+1), showing addition is denoted with concatenation. As a result, we know the numerals 1, 2, and 3, which are *atausiq, malġuk*, and *piŋasut* respectively. Similarly, *tallimat*, *qulit*, and *akimiaq* are 5, 10, and 15 respectively. Additionally, 30=20+10, so *iñuiññaq* is 20.

Our outlier is 14, or akimiaġutaiḷaq. In many counting systems, Roman numerals in particular, special notation is used for subtraction. For example, IX = 10-1. We can infer akimiaġutaiḷaq is 15-1, so adding "aġutaiḷ" right before the *aq* could denote "minus one".

This is enough information to complete D2 and D3 as shown in the table:

| Arabic | Iñupiaq |
| - | - |
| 3 | piŋasut |
| 11 (10+1) | qulit atausiq |
| 22 (20+2 | iñuiññaq malġuk |
| 1 | atausiq |
| 5 | tallimat |
| 20-1=19 | iñuiññaġutaiḷaq |

We can first recognize there are three numerals of the top left corner. Using our base 20 system we can decipher each, giving us  5\*20<sup>2</sup> + 1 \* 20 + 2 - 1 - (1 \* 20 + 7) = 2022, 1, and 27. Alternatively, it could be referring to a date, January 27, 2022.

Translating 27 into Iñupiaq, we have *iñuiññaq tallimat malġuk,* the second phrase on the board. We can infer the people uses a Month-Day-Year calendar, so *tallimaagliaq iñuiññaq malġuk* represents 2022. We already know *iñuiññaq malġuk* translates to 22, so the remaining word, tallimaagliaq, means 2000. "Tallima" could be following a suffix for large numbers, as "-agliaq" also appears in the prompt for D4. We notice 2000 = 400 * 5, and "tallima" represents 5. As a result, we now know what the suffix "-agliaq" does: multiply by 400. This makes sense because the Iñupiaq uses a base 20 system and 400 = 20<sup>2</sup>. Finally, quliagiaq has the root quli, which looks similar to 10, and our suffix "agliaq", giving us 10\* 400 = 4000.
