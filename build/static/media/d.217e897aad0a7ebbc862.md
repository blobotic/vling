The Permyak language is spoken by around 60,000 people on the western slope of the Ural Mountains in
Russia. It belongs to the Finno-Ugric language family, along with Finnish, Estonian, Hungarian, and other
languages that are mostly spoken in Russia.

**Notes:** ɨ and ə are special vowel sounds of Permyak; c, ɕ, and ɲ are pronounced similarly to k, s, and n,
respectively. The abbreviations sg. and pl. stand for *singular* and *plural*. The word *their* has a plural meaning
rather than a gender-neutral singular meaning.
