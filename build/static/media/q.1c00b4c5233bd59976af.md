Muklom is a language spoken by a few thousand people in Northeast India, a linguistic hotspot that harbors
languages from four different familiesː Sino-Tibetan, Austroasiatic, Tai-Kadai, and Indo-European. Muklom
belongs to the Sino-Tibetan family.

The Muklom people have a rich mythology and oral history that has been transmitted from generation to
generation in spoken form and in songs. The language has not historically been written. Or, according to the
traditional stories, the ancestors of the Muklom people actually did once have a writing system and they
wrote their stories on animal skins; however, one time, when the ancestors were very hungry, they ate all
the skins so that nothing remained of the written language. Since there is no standardized writing system for
Muklom, the examples below are presented using a preliminary spelling.

and then answer the questions on the next page. See the end of the problem for pronunciation notes.
