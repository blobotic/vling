Exciting news: You’ve gotten clearance to visit Mars! Your job there is to take care of some Martian animals
called vloxes. Here are the nine vloxes that you are in charge of:

:div[![vloxes](/pimg/naclo2023c-1.png)]{.width-1000 .center}

Your manager asks you to identify which vloxes fit the following descriptions:

:::ntable{fmt=1}
• The two mellivu vloxes & • The two mellovu vloxes & • The two kibb vloxes
• The two azeltorf vloxes & • The qliqli vlox & • The imxo vlox
• The three ravv vloxes & • The kibbish-zuff vlox & • The zuffish-kibb vlox
:::

Unfortunately, many of these words are unfamiliar to you, and you don’t have a dictionary! Luckily, you do
have an encyclopedia article (on the next page) that uses these words. Even though the article doesn’t define
the words directly, you can figure out a lot about a word based on how it is used in context. In fact, this basic
strategy is an important approach in computational linguistics: When computers need to learn the meanings
of words, they do so by analyzing the contexts that those words appear in.

**C1.** Based on what you can infer from the encyclopedia article, fill in the letter or letters of the vloxes that fit
each description from your manager. You will need to use some letters more than once.

**C2.** Fill in the blanks to create a description of the youngest vlox in the image. Each blank should be filled in
with one of the following words: *kibb*, *womm*, *zuff*, *tezz*, *ravv*. You should not use the same word twice.

Here is the encyclopedia article about vloxes that you should use to help you understand the unfamiliar
words in your manager’s descriptions.

*From Marsipedia, the Martian encyclopedia*

The vlox (*Vloxis vloxia*) is the most imxo species of zoobleporf. Due to its playful disposition, it is a popular pet throughout mars.

Vloxes occur in two breeds: the polar vlox and the valley vlox. Polar vloxes are usually more mellivu than valley vloxes.:sup[[1]] Regardless of breed, all vloxes are born completely qliqli. As they mature, they become less and less qliqli. It is believed that all prehistoric vloxes were zuffish-kibb or tezzish-kibb, but modern vloxes display great variety in zlorvitude.

- In the "Olympus Mons Explorers" comics, Captain Dfdgb's spaceship is called *The Mellovu Vlox*.
- The first Martian prime minister, Jzirla Jzirlsdaughter, was often seen with her kibbish-zuff vlox named Klgrdm.
- In the sitcom "Phobos and Deimos," the main character Phobos has three imxo vloxes: a kibb vlox named Blorblim, a zuffish-ravv vlox named Qqqq, and a ravvish-womm vlox named Robert.
- The most popular song by the Bellona Quartet is "Lookin' Like a Nearly Azeltorf Vlox," which spent seven weeks at the #1 position on the Mercury Top 60 Chart.

:sup[1]In a previous edition of this encyclopedia, we said that polar vloxes are more mellovu than valley vloxes. This was a typo - obviously, it makes no sense to say "more mellovu"!
