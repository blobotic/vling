Sentences can be true, false, or, sometimes, truly nonsensical. For sentences of the form, "The [subject] is
[predicate)", we can divide them into "sensible" and "nonsensical" groups:

:::ntable{fmt=1 .no1Count .no2Count .width2-600 .c3ml4}
|sensible & & nonsensical &
The moon is purple. & ✔ & The idea is purple.  & ✖
The game is an hour long. & ✔ & The pig is an hour long.  & ✖
The girl is sorry. & ✔ & The fear is sorry.  & ✖
:::

In 1959, philosopher Fred Sommers theorized that the predicates of any language were organized in binary
tree structure, according to which subjects they could be used sensibly with. In 1979, psychologist Frank C.
Keil tested Sommers' tree theory by asking children whether given English sentences made sense or not or and
diagramming the results. He confirmed Sommers' theory, producing trees like this one:

Here are some English sentences that use words you may not be familiar with:

:::ntable{fmt=1 .width2-600 .c3ml4}
The morkle is phlebular. & ✔ & The groob is brastic. & ✔ 
The humbrid is phlebular. & ✔ & The vippage is molistic.  & ✖
The morkle is luctious.  & ✖ & The quexor is molistic.  & ✖
The quexor is luctious. & ✔ & The thalf is molistic. & ✔ 
The pladry is luctious. & ✔ & The humbrid is molistic. & ✔ 
The groob is efrimious.  & ✖ & The groob is frungent.  & ✖

The pladry is frungent. & ✖ & The thalf is stibbly.  & ✖
The groob is stibbly. & ✖ & The groob is luctious. & ✖

Here is a tree that shows the semantic structure of the words used in these sentences. Note that each num-
ber and letter in the tree corresponds to exactly one word.
