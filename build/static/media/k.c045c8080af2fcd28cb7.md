A new board game craze is sweeping the globe: Wordnet Battleship! This game is similar to the strategy
guessing game Battleship where two players try to guess where the other one has placed a fleet of ships on
a ruled grid. But unlike the traditional Battleship game, Wordnet Battleship replaces the ruled grid with a
tree diagram of words that are hierarchically associated to each other based on their meaning. The diagram
works like this: The word at the top of the diagram has the most general meaning. The diagram then splits
into a set of words that are a bit more specific in meaning than the word at the top. Each of those words
splits into more words that are more specific than the word above them, and so on.

For example, in the wordnet diagram below, the verb *do* splits into *create*, *modify*, and *perform*, which are
more specific types of doing. The verb *perform* then splits into the verbs *serenade* and *improvise*, which are
two specific ways to perform. Since the diagram is based on word meaning, words with multiple meanings
appear in multiple different locations in a wordnet based on their individual separate meanings.

The wordnet diagram above is the right size for playing a beginner-level round of the game Wordnet
Battleship. In this level of play, each player has three ships that must be strategically placed on the diagram
based on a set of rules. The 3 ships are:
- A **frigate**, which takes up 3 positions on a wordnet diagram
- A **yacht**, which takes up 2 positions on a wordnet diagram
- A **rowboat**, which takes up 2 positions on a wordnet diagram
The rules for concealing ships within a wordnet diagram are:
1. Each ship must be placed on a chain of directly connected words in the wordnet diagram. The
chain may not use two words on the same level. For example, a frigate can be placed on *scribble-mark-modify*, but it cannot be placed on *copy-print-scribble*, *do-mark-copy*, or *copy-mark-scribble*.
2. A player’s ships cannot overlap. For example, if a player places their frigate on *generate-produce-create* on their wordnet diagram, they can’t also place their yacht on *breed-produce*.
3. The two players have distinct copies of the same wordnet diagram on which to conceal their ships.
It is therefore entirely possible for them to place their ships on the same positions as their
opponent. For example, both players might coincidentally place their yacht on *print-produce*.

Once both players have placed their ships, they begin the game. The players take turns trying to guess the
specific positions in their opponent’s wordnet diagram where a ship is hiding. To make a guess, a player
says the relevant word out loud and uses that word in a sentence that indicates the meaning of the word.
Their opponent follows up with either the reply “Miss” (if no part of a ship is covering the word with that
meaning on their own wordnet diagram) or “Hit” (if part of a ship is covering the word with that meaning
on their own wordnet diagram). When the final part of a ship is hit for a given ship, the opponent says,
“Hit—you have sunk my [NAME OF SHIP].”

Two players have just finished playing a round of the beginner level of Wordnet Battleship using the
wordnet diagram shown on the previous page. Below are two tables listing all the guesses and responses
that transpired during this game. To make it easy for you to keep track of who guessed what, we have
grouped together all of Player 1’s guesses with the corresponding responses from Player 2 in one table,
and all of Player 2’s guesses with the corresponding responses from Player 1 in another table.

**K1.** Two of Player 2’s guesses are missing. On your Answer Sheet, fill in examples of what these guesses
might have been. Your answer should include both the word and an example sentence that clearly
illustrates the meaning of that word given its position in the wordnet diagram (there are many possible
example sentences).

**K2.** Where are Player 2’s ships (that is, where are the ships that Player 1 is trying to sink)? Your answer
should simply list the words without example sentences. When listing the words, order does not matter.

The advanced level of Wordnet Battleship requires a different and larger wordnet diagram with nouns
instead of verbs. In this level of play, each player has the following fleet of 6 ships:
- An **aircraft carrier**, which takes up 5 positions
- A **battleship**, which takes up 4 positions
- A **cruiser**, which takes up 3 positions
- A **submarine**, which takes up 3 positions
- A **destroyer**, which takes up 2 positions
- A **patrol boat**, which takes up 2 positions

Otherwise the game proceeds just like the version seen previously.

The next two pages contain the record of a game of advanced Wordnet Battleship. This game was played
between Player 3, whose guesses are on Page 4/5, and Player 4, whose guess are on Page 5/5. Although
you have access to this game record, you do not have access to the wordnet diagram that the players were
referring to. Instead, you must figure out the structure of this diagram based on the record of the game.

For this game, you can assume the following:
- Every position in the wordnet diagram is guessed by at least one of the players.
- Answers (k) appears twice—as the final answer in the first table and the final answer in the second
table. This answer should be exactly the same in both positions, using the same word and the same
example sentence.
- All of the blanks in the rightmost column should be filled with a single word (either *Hit* or *Miss*).

**K3.** Fill in the blanks indicated in the tables on the next two pages. If there are multiple correct answers,
you only need to give one.
